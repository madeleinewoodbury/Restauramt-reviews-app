# Restaurant Reviews App (Stage One)

---

## Description

This project is created as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. The project is to convert a static webpage into a mobile-ready web application. The site also uses a service worker to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets (so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline).

## Run Application

These instructions are for running the application locally:

1. [Download zip](https://github.com/madeleinewoodbury/restaurant-reviews-app/archive/master.zip)
   Extract zip file
2. Using the terminal, navigate to the folder in order ro set up a simple HTTP server. Make sure python is installed on your computer.
   - To start the server with Python 2: `-m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
   - To start the server with Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
3. When the server is running: navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
